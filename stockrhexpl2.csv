1,"""Discriminatory manifestations that are highly determinative of wellbeing / health outcomes in the Black community (e.g., mortality, morbidity) and/or wealth accumulation."" ","""Harm onto local or groups where known disparity is limited to highly localized subgroups or internal business/ enterprise dynamics.""","""Identified harm has shown measurable improvement in 1 or more standardized metrics of wellness or wealth associated with harm typology within the last 5 calendar years (2019-2024).""",,,,,
2,"""Discriminatory manifestations that are semi-determinative of wellbeing / health outcomes in the Black community (e.g.,  mortality, morbidity) and/or wealth accumulation.""","""Harm is geographically regional or covariant with other phenomenon where the impact is disproportionally borne by Blacks. Impact known to be focused on regional geography, characteristics present across multiple regions; or manifested across key sub-population or grouping within the Black community.""  ","""Lack of measurable improvement in 1 more standardized metric of wellness or wealth associated with harm typology within the last 5 calendar years (2019-2024) and/or  the identification of research demonstrating both progress and persistence of a harm vector.""",,,,,
3,"""Activities with lower material impacts (non or low determinative) on wellbeing / health outcomes in the Black community (e.g., mortality, morbidity) and/or wealth accumulation."" ","""Harm coverage does not meet definitions of other cohort groupings and is not limited to a regional geography or population subgroup.""","""Identified harm has shown measurable deterioration or worsening in 1 or more standardized metrics of wellness or wealth associated with harm typology within the last 5 calendar years (2019-2024).""",,,,,
